#Module 1 Challenge: Kickstarter Outcomes
By Naman Puri

##Overview of Project
The purpose of the Kickstarter Project is an extension of the work we have done in Module 1. It is to show Louise, our client, how the different campaigns that she ran performed relative to the campaign’s launch dates and their funding goals. To accomplish this, we used the Kickstarter dataset in order to help visualize the campaign’s outcomes in relation to other campaigns. 
##Analysis & Challenges
As for challenges, I did not encounter any major ones. One of the challenges was trying to edit the COUNTIFS() function for each cell in Deliverable 2, which required us to help visualize each campaign within a certain monetary goal amount. I had to input a different amount for each formula that I used in each of the columns to compensate for the changing values (i.e. Less than 1000 needed to be compensated by putting >1000 in the formula). Other challenges that I could have potentially encountered include formatting the graphs incorrectly by using the wrong information for the axis’, which would have resulted in a wrong graph entirely. 
##Results
###Theater Outcome by Launch Date Conclusions
One conclusion I can share regarding Theater outcomes is that it deliver the most success when launched in May, with the highest number of successes at 111 in relation to any other month. 
Another conclusion I can share is that the number of failed theater outcomes versus launch data are more or less along the same trajectory between successes and failures throughout the months. When success spikes, failure tends to spike as well. When success dips, failure also tends to dip. 
###Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion
A conclusion I can draw from Outcomes Based on Goals is that it has a roughly inverse relationship between percentage of successful campaigns and percentage of failed campaigns, while number and percentage of canceled campaigns have remained the same at 0.
##Summary of Limitations
I think a limit with regards to the Kickstarter dataset is that we are only focusing on the launch dates and funding goals of each campaign. 
#Suggestions
A suggestion that could be more helpful in extracting more accurate and precise information is to also include the pledged amounts as that provides us with more realistic results, which can be used for any future campaigns.
